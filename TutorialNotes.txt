C-Make Tutorials:

to use math lib in code it has to be named in command prompt
        -l m

Automating builds in MakeFiles
Structure:

    .c (source file)
            |  Preprocessor: handles #include, define & strips out comments
            V
    "processed file" (copies imports into file itself)
            |   Compiler:   translate c to assembly)
            V
        .s - file
            |   assembler:  translates assembly to object file
            V
        .o - file
            |   linker:     brings together the object file to produce executable
            V
           exec
BIOS - Commands:
    - run Preprocessor: -E
    - run Compiler:     -S
    - run assembler:    -c
    - to output exec:   -o
    (commands always run from .c to the step anounced)

to reuse files:
    - include all files sepperately

    OR
    - write a function prototype
    - compile files to an objectfile
    - compile all of them together
        Process: (=dependency-Tree)
                d.c     gd.c
                 |       |      (clang -c d.c
                 V       V        clang -c gd.c)
                d.o     gd.o
                 \        /     (clang d,o gd,o -o complete -l m)
                  V      V
                  complete
    OR
    - write h files
        -> .h only includes FunctionPortotypes, defines, includes
      and include these

    OR
    makeFiles -- see the makeFile in geom-Folder
    every call of make compiles only the things that change
